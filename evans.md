**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a question about the paper(s) on the first issues <a href= "https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Fall2021/issues/1"> page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository.</a>

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, September 27 @ 11:59pm each of you will:

- Post the questions and comments you have about the suggested readings. 
- For this week's edition of the workshop, propose one or more computational social scientists we can invite for our seminar series this year, including a 1-2 sentence defense of why others might want to hear from them.

**Then by Thursday, Sep 30 @ 10:59am:**

- Upvote (“thumbs up”) **at least 5** questions from other people. Upvote questions and recommendations you like or would like to critique.
- Respond with YOUR answer or follow-on engagement to one of those 5 questions. 
- Uprank 5 other proposals. We will invite the top-most upranked people for the seminar over the course of the year.
